Path Planning Using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This Python project demonstrates a path planning algorithm using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in a 2D grid environment with obstacles. The goal is to find the shortest and safest path from a start to a goal position while avoiding obstacles.

Overview

The algorithm simulates a group of "particles" (candidate paths) that explore the environment. Each particle represents a set of waypoints between the start and goal.
Through iterative updates influenced by personal and global best solutions, the swarm converges toward an optimal or near-optimal path that minimizes the total travel distance and avoids collisions.
